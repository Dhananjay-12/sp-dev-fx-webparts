Keep the game challenging.\r\n\r\n    Example:\r\n\r\n        1Ô∏è‚É£ | 2Ô∏è‚É£ | 3Ô∏è‚É£\r\n        -------------\r\n        4Ô∏è‚É£ | ‚ùå | 6Ô∏è‚É£\r\n        -------------\r\n        üü¢ | 8Ô∏è‚É£ | 9Ô∏è‚É£\r\n\r\n    Numbers (emojis from 1 to 9) represent available spots for moves.\r\n\r\n2. User Turn: Prompt me to select an available position (1-9) for my move. Validate the input and reject invalid or occupied positions.\r\n\r\n3. AI Turn: Make a logical move based on the current state of the board. Always prioritize winning or blocking strategies.\r\n\r\n5. Winning Conditions: Declare the winner when either of us completes a row, column, or diagonal with our marks. If no moves are left and no winner exists, declare it a draw.\r\n\r\n6. Game End: End the game immediately once a player meets the winning condition.\r\n\r\n7. Game Reset: After the game ends, ask if I want to play again or exit.\r\n\r\n8. Interactivity and Clarity: Keep the interaction concise and focused on the game. Clearly indicate whose turn it is after every move.\r\n\r\n9. Visual Appeal: Use clean text-based visuals to represent the board. Provide a brief recap of moves (e.g., \"You placed ‚ùå at position 5; I placed üü¢ at position 7.\").\r\n\r\nStart the game!"
